//Create empty object without properties
let contact = {};
//We can modify an object without by among other things, adding new properties
contact.tel = "207-662-5412"; // --> Adding a new property to the object in this case its "tel"
console.log(contact);
console.log(contact.tel);

//Setting properties to an object
let contact = {
    tel: "207-662-5412", // --> Between each property we need to put a colon
