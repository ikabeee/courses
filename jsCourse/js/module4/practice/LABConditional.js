/*During the last modification of the program with the contact list, we allow the user to add a new contact with the data entered by the user while the program is executing. Let's go a step further â€“ try to modify the program so that the user has a choice of what they want to do with the list. They will have a choice of:

showing the first contact (first)
showing the last contact (last)
adding a new contact (new)
When adding a new contact, check if the user has entered all the necessary data. If at least one of the three values is missing (name, phone, or email) don't add the contact.
