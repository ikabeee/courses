    <h1>What's CSS meaning?</h1>
    <p>CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML)</p>
    <h2>Why is called "Cascading?</h2>
    <p> This means that CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.</p>
    <h2>Seems like this cascade!</h2>
