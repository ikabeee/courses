    <h1>Modifying Properties on CSS!</h1>
    <h2>Selectors</h2>
    <p>Selectors are used to delimit the HTML elements of our web page to which we want to apply style. </p>
    <h2>Here is a selector example</h2>
    <img src="/assets/images/selectorCSS.png" alt="">
    <p>Brackets delimits declarations blocks. And we need to declare properties.</p>
    <h2>Selector types</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="test"><h2>By element</h2></li>
        <newElement>New Element Example</newElement>
        <br>
        <p>Look how our New Element HTML has been selected with our call on CSS. BUt this method it's a bad practice making ours elements.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/newElementExample.png" alt="Selector New Element">
        <br>
  
        <li class="test"><h2>By class ".". The best method!</h2></li>
        <img src="/assets/images/class.png" alt="Class as attribute">
        <br><br>
        <img src="/assets/images/selectorByClass.png" alt="Selector by Class on CSS">
        <p>To modify properties from any element you must call the class that you put it on the HTML element as our example but with a dot before to specify. For more examples please check source code.</p>
        
        <li id="idTest"> <h2>By ID "#"</h2></li>
        <p>In this case selecting elements by id it could help for those elements that you need to modify only once. Actually, it's almost the same process but instead to write "class" you are gonna write "id" as the example</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/idSelector.png" alt="ID Selector">
        <h2>How can I call my element on CSS?</h2>
        <p>Pretty simple, instead to call an element by dot you are gonna write "#" as the example and the name that you called it before on HTML document. This method it's a bad practice at the moment while you are coding on JS (Javascript).</p>
