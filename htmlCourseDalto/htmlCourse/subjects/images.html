    <h1>Images tags</h1>
    <h2>‚è¨This is how works an img tag</h2>
    <p>Image its our tag but we need an attribute for get to work our img so we are gonna to add a src attribute and write where is located our picture</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/cat.png" title="Cute Cat">
    <h2>What happens if we have an error with ours images? You need to add an alternative (alt) attribute! </h2>
    <h2>Why it's so important alternative attribute?</h2>
    <p>If our server or page has a problem with loading assets archives, users needs to know what was the image. Now imagine you are blind and you use tools like VoiceOver, you aren't gonna to know what was the image if the page doesn't have an alternative attribute</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <img src="/assets/images/catError.png" title="Cute Cat Error" alt="Cute Cat">
    <p>In this case I  intentionally wrote wrong my src attribute, see hows it works alt attribute. You're gonna see "Cute Cat" instead of an image. It's important to know this data that we're writing are gonna to be used for SEO.</p>
    <h2>NOTE: img tag its called as "Self closing tags" because you don't need to close it</h2>
