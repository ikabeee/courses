    <br><br>
    <h2>⏬ This below it is a link tag with blank as attribute</h2>
    <p>If you wanna open the link on a new tab you need to add target attribute. Target attribute it's always on ours links tags but with "_self" which means that link its gonna open on the same tab looks like "target="_self"</p>
